<h2>3. General information and mandatory information</h2>
<h3>Data protection</h3>
<p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
<p>When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data that personally identifies you. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>
<p>We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
<h3>Note on the responsible party</h3>
<p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
<p>Fluttera OÜ<br />
    VAT ID: EE102661059 <br />
    Reg. no: 16827919 <br />
    Sepapaja tn 6<br />
    15551 Tallinn, Estonia</p>
<p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>

<h3>Storage duration</h3>
<p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.</p>
<h3>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website</h3>
<p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your end device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
<h3>Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries</h3>
<p>We use, among other things, tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as the data subject being able to take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. intelligence services) process, evaluate, and permanently store your data on US servers for surveillance purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.</p>
<h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
<h3>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
<p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
<p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>
<h3>Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</h3>
<p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.</p>
<h3>Right to data portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>
<h3>Information, correction, and deletion</h3>
<p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, the right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
<h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
<p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
    <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
    <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
    <li>If you have filed an objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
<h2>4. Data collection on this website</h2>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Our websites use so-called "cookies". Cookies are small data packages and do not cause any damage to your end device. They are stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your end device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them yourself or until they are automatically deleted by your web browser.</p>
<p>Cookies can come from us (first-party cookies) or from third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services from third-party companies within websites (e.g. cookies for processing payment services).</p>
<p>Cookies have various functions. Numerous cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them (e.g. the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies can be used to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>Cookies that are necessary for carrying out the electronic communication process, for providing certain functions desired by you (e.g. for the shopping cart function) or for optimizing the website (e.g. cookies for measuring the web audience) (necessary cookies) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent to the storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies has been requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG); the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. When deactivating cookies, the functionality of this website may be limited.</p>
<p>You can find out which cookies and services are used on this website in this privacy policy.</p>
<h2>5. Newsletter</h2>
<h3>Newsletter data</h3>
<p>If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an e-mail address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified e-mail address and agree to receive the newsletter. Further data is not collected or only on a voluntary basis. We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
<p>The processing of the data entered in the newsletter registration form is based exclusively on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke the consent you have given to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and its use for sending the newsletter at any time, for example via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
<p>The data you have stored with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter or after the purpose no longer applies. We reserve the right to delete or block e-mail addresses from our newsletter distribution list at our own discretion within the scope of our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
<p>Data stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected by this.</p>
<p>After you have unsubscribed from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist, if this is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is only used for this purpose and is not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is not limited in time. <strong>You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</strong></p>

<h3>YouTube</h3>
<p>This website embeds videos from the YouTube website. The operator of the website is Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
<p>When you visit one of our web pages on which YouTube is embedded, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. This tells the YouTube server which of our pages you have visited.</p>
<p>Furthermore, YouTube may store various cookies on your end device or use comparable technologies for recognition (e.g. device fingerprinting). This allows YouTube to receive information about visitors to this website. This information is used, among other things, to collect video statistics, improve user-friendliness, and prevent fraud attempts.</p>
<p>If you are logged into your YouTube account, you enable YouTube to associate your surfing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.</p>
<p>The use of YouTube is in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offers. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user's end device (e.g. device fingerprinting) as defined in the TTDSG.
